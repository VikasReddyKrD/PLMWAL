<p>You will need your login credentials (username and password) for all of your providers’ patient portals to sign in and connect your medical
records.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bolder">Note:</span> A patient portal is a secure online website where you can view and access your health information from your provider with a
username and password. (e.g. https://mychart.martinhealth.org/mychart/Authentication/Login) If you do not have access to your providers’
patient portals, contact your providers directly.</p>
